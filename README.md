# Home Loan Application Chatbot

This is a smart Streamlit-based chatbot designed to collect all relevant data for a home loan application through a dynamic, multi-turn conversation. The system guides users by asking only the missing or incomplete details, adapting its prompts based on previous responses. It uses LangChain, LangGraph, and a local LLM model served via Ollama to intelligently extract structured fields from natural language input.
